# Cafe Recommender API

Cafe Recommender API is a simple web service that suggests cafes in different cities based on the requested number of recommendations. It supports a few predefined cities and cafes.

## Features

- Get a list of cafes in a specific city.
- Specify how many cafes you want to receive.

## How It Works

The service accepts two query parameters:
- `city`: The city for which you want to get cafe recommendations (e.g., `moscow`).
- `count`: The number of cafe names you want to get back.
